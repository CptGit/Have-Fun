# Just4Fun

*Welcome to **Just4Fun***.

Here are some little creatures more than two years old. They are so rudimentary...due to my limited programming skills then. Sorry, for some reasons, I have lost the source codes and all remaining now is the setups. However, just download them and you may have fun all the same.

## HB
It can play the song "Happy birthday" using your PC's bell.

Platform: Windows

> Actually it was a birthday gift and that was a sad story.:(

## SandPainting
It is an app to help you turn your image into a sand-painting.

Platform: Android

> Attention: Some people other than me also contribute a lot to the app. Thank them.
